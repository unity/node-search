#A quick hack to add exact match to node-search, by Romain Dardour

Beware, the return format has been changed to allow selecting raw or phonetic searches.
The return object is now in the format: 
         {
           raw: searchResults,
           phonetic: searchResults,
         }
This was the quickest way to detect if exact matches were found, and use them instead of phonetic ones, or use both.

# A JavaScript full text search engine

This is an implementation of a "vector space model" with "Porter stemming", "double-metaphones", false boolean searches, field searching and field weighting. Basically it a full text search engine that has most of the fancy features the well known search engines libraries like Sphinx, Solr, Lucene, etc. The big difference is that it is written in JavaScript originally for use with Node.js.


## Example

	var NodeSearch = require('./../lib/node-search').NodeSearch;
	var nStore = require('./lib/nstore');

	// A simple data set to search over, feel free to use any data source, nstore uses JavaScript objects so it's simple
	var db = nStore('data/example.db');

	var search = new NodeSearch();
	search.fieldWeights.title = 2; // Make one/or many of the document fields more important
	var stream = db.stream();
	stream.addListener('data', function (doc, meta) {
		search.index(meta.key,doc);
	});

	stream.addListener('end', function () { // when the indexing is finished
		search.query("meet !poultry", null, function (results) { // search and wait for the results
			results.forEach(function(result){
				db.get(result.key, function (err, doc, meta) { 
					if(err) throw err;
					console.log(result.key+" "+doc.title +" "+doc.body +" "+  result.rank);
				});
			});
		});
	});

## Things that it doesn't currently do but would like to look into:	

	Phrase based searches, everything is word based, combonations of words are not currently supported
	Exact matches, all words are converted to stemmed metaphones so "ponies" is indexed as the sound of "pony".
	Date based searches or other meta data with additional logic are not currently supported
	tf-idf based ranking, currently using a term count
